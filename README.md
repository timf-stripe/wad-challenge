# We Are Developers - Stripe Challenge

Integrate with Stripe's hosted Checkout page to accept payments with very little code.

## How to get started

Fork this repo into your own GitHub account. Make sure you're set up to use GitHub Pages (you'll need the repo to be public for this to work). We've built a basic starter website for you along with the shell of a Stripe implementation. Finish the implementation and successfully submit a test purchase to win!

Modify the script in index.html to correctly pass the user session to Stripe. We've built this mini-challenge so that no external editors or tools are needed, just edit directly in GitHub and commit.

## Helpful documentation

This implementation uses a client-only model as [detailed here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/client).

You'll probably want to use [this JS reference](https://stripe.com/docs/js/checkout/redirect_to_checkout) to help.
